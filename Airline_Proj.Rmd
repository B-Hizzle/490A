## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
airline_original <- read_csv("airline.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Remove rows with any missing data
airline <- na.omit(airline_original)

#View(airline)
```

```{r}
names(airline)[3] <- "Customer_Type"
names(airline)[5] <- "Type_Travel"
names(airline)[7] <- "Flight_Distance"
names(airline)[8] <- "Seat_Comfort"
names(airline)[9] <- "DepArrv_Time_Conv"
names(airline)[10] <- "Food_Drink"
names(airline)[11] <- "Gate_Locat"
names(airline)[12] <- "Inflight_Wifi"
names(airline)[13] <- "Inflight_Entmt"
names(airline)[14] <- "Online_Support"
names(airline)[15] <- "Ease_Online_Book"
names(airline)[16] <- "Onboard_Service"
names(airline)[17] <- "Legroom"
names(airline)[18] <- "Baggage_Handling"
names(airline)[19] <- "Checkin_Service"
names(airline)[21] <- "Online_Boarding"
names(airline)[22] <- "Dept_Delay_Min"
names(airline)[23] <- "Arrv_Delay_Min"
View(airline)

```

```{r}
ggplot(airline, aes(x = Gender, y = Age, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  # Create box plot
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Age by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Age") +  # Add labels
  theme_minimal() 

ggplot(airline, aes(x = Class, y = Age, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  # Create box plot
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Age by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Age") +  # Add labels
  theme_minimal() 

ggplot(airline, aes(x = satisfaction, y = Inflight_Wifi, fill = satisfaction)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  # Create box plot
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Inflight Wifi by Satisfaction", x = "Satisfaction", y = "Infight Wifi") +  # Add labels
  theme_minimal() 

ggplot(airline, aes(x = satisfaction, y = Inflight_Entmt, fill = satisfaction)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  # Create box plot
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Inflight Entertainment by Satisfaction", x = "Satisfaction", y = "Infight Entertainment") +  # Add labels
  theme_minimal() 


```

```{r}
names(airline)[6] <- "Class_Business"
airline$satisfaction=ifelse(airline$satisfaction=="satisfied",1,0) #vs dissatisfied
airline$Gender=ifelse(airline$Gender=="Female",1,0)
airline$Customer_Type=ifelse(airline$Customer_Type=="Loyal Customer",1,0) #vs disloyal customer
airline$Type_Travel=ifelse(airline$Type_Travel=="Personal Travel",1,0) # vs Business travel
airline <- airline %>%
  mutate(Class_Eco = ifelse(Class_Business == 'Eco', 1, 0))
airline$Class_Business=ifelse(airline$Class_Business=="Business",1,0)
View(airline)

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
